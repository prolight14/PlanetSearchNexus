# Planet Search Nexus

(WIP)

A game made with the Phaser 3 Game Engine using OriginTrail's DKG client to publish player's game states to the ODN.

## Running

Make sure you have node js, npm, vscode, webpack, the typescript compiler (tsc)
and the vscode live server (or just any localhost live server) installed. 

After that run `npm install`
then run `webpack -w`
then `tsc --watch -p ./src --outDir ./nodeSrc`

Finally run it in the live server.

That should get you running the game.
